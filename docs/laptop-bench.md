# Benching on the school laptop

Windows, Intel integrated graphics, Prism Launcher. Quicksilver 0.0.1 only measures, so every number from this build is
a **vanilla** number: the baseline later packages are judged against.

Run two instances: a plain one (vanilla Fabric, Fabric API, Quicksilver) and the test pack (CI's popular-mods pack) with
Quicksilver added. (Until 2026-11-12 the second was SIFTEC; SIFTEC is scrapped.)

## Before each session

- Plug the charger in and set Windows to its best-performance power mode.
- Close the browser and anything else heavy.
- Keep the game window focused and don't touch mouse or keyboard while a bench is measuring (the chat says when it
  starts and ends). 

## Get Quicksilver

Download `quicksilver-26.3.jar` from the `latest` release of meakaandre-tech/Quicksilver on GitHub.

## Instance 1: plain

1. In Prism: **Add Instance** → Minecraft **26.3** → Mod loader **Fabric**, loader **0.19.5** → OK.
2. Instance → **Edit** → **Mods** → **Download mods** → add **Fabric API** for 26.3 (0.161.0+26.3 or newer).
   Then **Add file** → `quicksilver-26.3.jar`.
3. Edit → **Settings** → Java: use a **Java 25** runtime (Prism can download it). Memory: set max memory to what you
   normally give Minecraft and write it down.
4. Edit → Settings → **Game windows**: tick "Start Minecraft with a custom window size", **1280 × 720**.
5. Launch. In Options → Video Settings: **Max Framerate: Unlimited**, **VSync: Off**, **GUI Scale: 2**, Graphics API
   left on **Default**. Leave the rest as you play.
6. **Singleplayer → Create New World**: Game Mode **Creative**, **Allow Commands: On**, More → **Seed: 12345**,
   World Type Default. Create it and wait 30 seconds in the world.
7. Type these one at a time, waiting for "[Quicksilver] Bench ... done" before the next (each takes about 1.5 minutes).
   A scene changes the world (gamerules, time, weather, game mode, your position, blocks and mobs it places), so the
   bench refuses until you add `confirm`; without it, it tells you what it will change:

   ```
   /quicksilver bench flythrough confirm
   /quicksilver bench spawn confirm
   /quicksilver bench water_glass confirm
   /quicksilver bench mobs confirm
   /quicksilver bench nether confirm
   ```

   Run `flythrough` first: it flies over terrain that has never been generated, which is only true in a new world.
8. Memory after 10 minutes (one run is enough): `/quicksilver bench spawn 600 confirm`.
9. Quit to the title screen.

## Instance 2: the test pack

1. In Prism: **Add Instance** → Minecraft 26.3, Fabric (the same loader as the plain instance). Edit → Mods → **Add
   file**: Fabric API, `quicksilver-26.3.jar`, and every jar of the `pack` and `packclient` sets in
   `ci/pack-sources.txt` (each line is the jar's own download link; Create Fly is the `create-fly-26.3.jar` asset of
   this repo's `pack-snapshot` release). Same Java, memory and 1280 × 720 window as above; same video settings
   (Unlimited, VSync off, GUI scale 2). In Options → Resource Packs, move **Continuity: Default Connected Textures**
   to the right (on), as CI does.
2. **Create a new world** just for this: Creative, **Allow Commands: On**, **Seed: 12345**. The scenes build
   platforms, so never run them in a world you play in.
3. Wait 30 seconds, then run, one at a time:

   ```
   /quicksilver bench flythrough confirm
   /quicksilver bench minimap confirm
   /quicksilver bench geckolib confirm
   /quicksilver bench terrain confirm
   /quicksilver bench continuity confirm
   /quicksilver bench create_ct confirm
   /quicksilver bench kinetics confirm
   /quicksilver bench jei confirm
   /quicksilver bench ponder confirm
   ```

   `jei` and `ponder` open a screen (the inventory, Create's Ponder index): the chat says what to press or type, and
   measuring starts when it opens. Leave it open: the bench closes it when it is done. The belt and the train in
   `kinetics` need CI's own command, so in your instance that scene shows the shafts and the station without them.
4. Memory after 10 minutes: `/quicksilver bench kinetics 600 confirm`.

## What to paste back

Open the instance folder (Prism: right-click → **Folder**) → `.minecraft/logs/latest.log` (or `minecraft/logs`).
Each bench wrote one block:

```
===== QUICKSILVER BENCH BEGIN =====
  scene: ...
  ...
===== QUICKSILVER BENCH END =====
```

Paste every block, and say which instance it came from and the max memory you set. The same numbers are also in
`.minecraft/quicksilver/bench/*.json` if a block is easier to send as a file.

If a scene says it stopped (for example "the HubScreen screen was not opened within 2 minutes"), paste that line too.

## Vanilla, Sodium and Quicksilver side by side (package 4b)

One plain instance, three mod sets, the same seed and scenes, so the three logs compare directly. The **bench-only
jar** (`quicksilver-bench-26.3.jar`, in the same `latest` release as `quicksilver-26.3.jar`) is `/quicksilver bench`, its
counters and its scenes with every Quicksilver module left out: it changes nothing, so with it the game draws as vanilla
does (or as Sodium does, next to Sodium). Quicksilver itself has the same bench built in.

| run | mods folder (besides Fabric API) |
|---|---|
| vanilla | `quicksilver-bench-26.3.jar` |
| Sodium | `quicksilver-bench-26.3.jar` and Sodium **0.9.2** for 26.3 (Prism: Download mods, Modrinth, "Sodium", pick 0.9.2) |
| Quicksilver | `quicksilver-26.3.jar` only |

Never put the bench-only jar next to Quicksilver, or Quicksilver next to Sodium: the game refuses to start (each says so).

1. Make the plain instance as in "Instance 1: plain" above (steps 1-5: Fabric 26.3, loader 0.19.5, Fabric API, Java 25,
   1280 x 720, Max Framerate Unlimited, VSync Off, GUI Scale 2), but add only the jars in the table above, not step 2's
   `quicksilver-26.3.jar` in every copy. Then copy it twice in Prism (right-click, **Copy
   Instance**) and name the three copies `bench-vanilla`, `bench-sodium`, `bench-quicksilver`. Put the mods from the table
   in each. Sodium has its own video settings screen: set the same Max Framerate, VSync and GUI Scale there, leave the
   rest on Sodium's defaults.
2. In each instance, one after the other (not at the same time), with the charger in and nothing else open:
   **Create New World**, Creative, Allow Commands On, **Seed 12345**, World Type Default. Wait 30 seconds, then run one at
   a time, waiting for "[Quicksilver] Bench ... done" each time:

   ```
   /quicksilver bench flythrough confirm
   /quicksilver bench spawn confirm
   /quicksilver bench water_glass confirm
   /quicksilver bench nether confirm
   /quicksilver bench mobs confirm
   ```

   A new world each time, in every instance, so all three start from the same freshly generated terrain; `flythrough`
   first: it flies over terrain that was never generated, which is where upload spikes and stutter show. Quit to the title screen after the last one.
3. Paste back the five bench blocks of each instance from `logs/latest.log` (or send the JSON files from
   `quicksilver/bench/`), saying which instance each came from.

What to compare: `fps` (average and 1% low), `frame time ms` (p99 and frames over 50 ms; the floor is 1% lows of at least
30 FPS), `upload bytes/frame` (its max is the largest upload in one frame), and `heap MB`. In the Quicksilver instance the
`backFaces` and `uploadBudget` lines say how many triangles were left out and how many sections waited for a later frame.
Draw calls are counted where the game draws through its own graphics layer (renderpearl); a mod that draws past it would
show fewer draw calls than it makes, so for Sodium compare frame times and FPS first.

## Phase 2: server numbers (P2-0)

From the build with phase 2's harness on, every bench block has a `server:` line too. In single player that is the
integrated server inside your game: milliseconds per tick (average, median, 99th percentile, max, ticks over 50 ms)
over the bench's measured seconds, heap used, the client's start-up time to the title screen and the world's load
time. Network bytes are 0 in single player (the client talks to its own server in memory), which is expected.

Nothing extra to run for most of it: the steps above already give the numbers phase 2's targets need. To make them
comparable, do these the same way every time:

1. **Start-up:** close Prism's other instances, then launch the instance and don't click anything until the title
   screen shows. The first bench block's `server:` line has `start-up ms` (JVM start to the title screen).
2. **World load:** for each instance, after the title screen, open the bench world (Singleplayer → the seed-12345
   world → Play). The `world load ms` in the next bench block is the server's start, including loading that world.
3. **Heap after load:** the first bench after joining (`flythrough` in a new world): read `after GC` in its `heap MB`
   line (the `server:` line's heap is taken without a GC, so it moves with garbage).
4. **Heap after 10 minutes:** the 600-second bench in step 8 (plain) and step 4 (test pack), `after GC` in `heap MB`.
5. **MSPT while flying over new terrain:** the `flythrough` block's `server:` line (`p99` and `over 50 ms` are what
   the "no server tick over 50 ms" target reads).
6. **Create factory:** the `kinetics` block from Instance 2 (the server suite's factory scene runs in CI only).

Optional, a dedicated server (only if you want to see a server on its own; the laptop targets are single player):
start a Fabric 26.3 server with Fabric API and the same Quicksilver jar (`quicksilver-26.3.jar`) in its
`mods` folder, join it, play or wait
a minute, then type `quicksilver bench 60` (or `qs bench 60`) in the server console. It writes the same `server:` numbers between
`===== QUICKSILVER SERVER BENCH BEGIN =====` and `===== QUICKSILVER SERVER BENCH END =====` in the server's
`logs/latest.log`, with network bytes this time.

Paste every `server:` line along with the blocks, as above.

/**
 * P2-2, logic.block-collisions. Vanilla's block collision sweep (BlockCollisions: every entity move, the supporting-block
 * check every tick, the in-wall check, space-empty tests) walks a box one block wider than the colliding box on every
 * side and reads the block at each position. It keeps a position only when (a) inside the box: the block's collision
 * shape is not empty and touches the box; (b) on a face of the outer shell: also the block has a large collision shape;
 * (c) on an edge of the shell: also the block is a moving piston; corners it drops unread.
 *
 * <p>Each chunk section here gets two masks of its 4096 positions, built from its block states when a sweep first needs
 * them: which positions hold anything but air, and which hold a state with a large collision shape or a moving piston.
 * A sweep then drops, unread, every position that holds air (air's collision shape is always empty) and every shell
 * position that holds neither kind of state. Those are exactly positions vanilla reads and then drops, so the same
 * shapes come out in the same order.
 *
 * <p>The masks are exact for the states the section's block container holds when they are used: every write to a
 * container (each of its write methods) counts up a number kept on it, masks built at another count, or for another
 * container, are built again, and a section's own setBlockState keeps them current. Only a server level's loaded
 * chunks inside the world's height are used, not debug worlds; anything else is left to vanilla.

/**
 * Skip back faces (package 4b): each solid and cutout layer's quads are stored grouped by facing ({@link
 * CompactVertex.Faces}), and a frame leaves out the axis groups that face away from the camera for the whole section.
 * The GPU would cull every one of those triangles anyway (the terrain pipelines cull back faces), so the picture is
 * unchanged: the gain is the vertex work for triangles that were never going to be drawn. Unaligned quads (plants,
 * slopes, rotated model parts) are always drawn; translucent layers keep vanilla's sorted order and are never split.
 *
 * <p>A +X group is left out only if the camera is at least {@link #MARGIN} blocks (plus twice how far the camera moved
 * since the last frame) on the negative side of the lowest plane any of its quads lies in, and likewise for the other
 * groups. The margin covers what moves the drawn eye away from the camera position Quicksilver reads: view bobbing
 * (well under a block), and a camera position from the previous frame. Without a camera position, after a jump of more
 * than {@link #JUMP} blocks, in a frame whose terrain pipelines do not cull back faces, or with
 * {@code -Dquicksilver.debug.drawAllFaces=true}, every group is drawn.
 *
 * <p>The groups that stay are index ranges inside the same draw: on the plain path entries of the same multi-draw, on
 * the indirect path one command per section layer covering the span from the first group kept to the last (more
 * commands would raise the bytes uploaded every frame), so draw calls and uploads don't rise. Where the device has no
 * multi-draw (one draw per section and layer, {@code PLAIN_SINGLE}), the same one span is drawn.
 * Idea common to terrain renderers (Sodium does something similar); written from the game's geometry only.
